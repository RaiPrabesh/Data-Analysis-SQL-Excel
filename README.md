# Cybersecurity Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes cybersecurity incident data across India, China, and the USA from 2015 to 2024. The analysis uses SQL and Excel to investigate trends, identify key vulnerabilities, and assess the financial impact of cyberattacks. This project demonstrates my data analysis skills, including data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and interpretation.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

1.  Determine the financial impact from different types of cyberattacks in India, China, and the USA.
2.  Analyze the relationship between security vulnerability types and incident resolution times in India, China, and the USA.
3.  Identify the most frequently targeted industries across the three countries.
4.  Examine the correlation between financial impact and the number of affected users due to cyberattacks.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project comes from [Add your data source here.  If you have multiple sources, list them all].  The data includes information on:

* Attack type
* Financial impact (in millions of dollars)
* Affected users
* Security vulnerability type
* Incident resolution time
* Defense mechanisms
* Industry
* Country
* Year

## Methods

The project employs a combination of SQL and Excel for data analysis:

* **SQL:** Used for data extraction, cleaning, filtering, and aggregation. Key SQL operations include:
    * Selecting data within a specific date range (2015-2024).
    * Filtering data by country (India, China, USA).
    * Grouping data by attack type, vulnerability type, and industry.
    * Calculating sums, averages, and other relevant metrics.
    * Joining tables (if applicable).
* **Excel:** Used for further data manipulation, visualization, and reporting. Key Excel techniques include:
    * Creating pivot tables to summarize data.
    * Generating charts (bar charts, scatter plots, dot plots) to visualize trends and relationships.
    * Calculating correlation coefficients.
    * Presenting findings in a clear and concise manner.

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals several key insights:

* **Financial Impact:** The USA experienced the highest overall financial impact from cyberattacks between 2015 and 2024, although the most damaging attack types vary by country.
* **Vulnerability and Resolution Time:** The relationship between security vulnerability type and incident resolution time varies across countries.
* **Targeted Industries:** The IT and Retail industries are consistently among the most frequently targeted across India, China, and the USA, and also suffer the greatest financial losses.
* **Correlation:** The correlation between financial impact and the number of affected users is generally weak across the three countries, suggesting other factors may be more influential in determining the extent of user impact.

## Visualizations
